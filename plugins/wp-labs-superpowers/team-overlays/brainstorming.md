## Team workflow: sync the approved spec to a GitHub issue

After the user approves the written spec (the User Review Gate passes) and BEFORE invoking
writing-plans, link the spec to GitHub issue tracking:

1. **Identify the tracking issue.** The spec derives from an existing issue if the conversation
   or the spec text references one (e.g. `#42` or a GitHub issue URL).
2. **If an existing issue is identified:** append the spec to it as a comment —
   `gh issue comment <number> --body-file <spec-path>`.
3. **If none is identified:** ask the user `Create a GitHub tracking issue for this spec? (Y/n)`.
   On yes (the default), create it with the spec as the body —
   `gh issue create --title "<spec slug>" --body-file <spec-path>`. On no, skip and note that no
   issue is linked.
4. **Record the issue** in the spec file as a `Tracking issue: <url>` line. writing-plans reads
   this line to post the plan as a comment.

**`.superpowers/` is git-ignored working space — do NOT commit the spec file.** The GitHub issue
created/updated above is the spec's durable record. This overrides any "commit the design document
to git" step earlier in this skill.

If `gh` is missing or unauthenticated, report it and continue — never block the workflow on it.
