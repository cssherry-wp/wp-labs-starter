# Hosting

How to run the app in a container locally and deploy it to Azure. The
scaffolding-sdlc skill copies the stack's `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, and
`docker-compose.yml` to the repo root, the Bicep under `infra/`, and a single
`cd.yml` into `.github/workflows/`.

You choose **one** hosting model at scaffold time, and the matching `infra/main.bicep`
+ `cd.yml` are installed:

- **App Service (container)** — turnkey web conveniences (Easy Auth, managed certs,
  deployment slots); always-on. Recommended for a single public web app. *(below)*
- **Azure Container Apps (ACA)** — scale-to-zero economics, automatic HTTP autoscaling,
  native revisions/traffic-splitting; cold starts when scaled to zero. *(further below)*

Both share the `Dockerfile`/`docker-compose.yml`, the ACR + Postgres Bicep, and the
Azure OIDC secrets.

## Run locally with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
# App: http://localhost:8000   (Postgres runs as the `db` service)
```

`docker-compose.yml` sets `DATABASE_URL` to the Postgres service, so the
container exercises the same database engine as production. Without
`DATABASE_URL` the app falls back to SQLite (plain `python manage.py runserver`).

- **Python (API)** — the image runs `migrate` then `gunicorn`.
- **Fullstack** — a multi-stage build compiles the React SPA, and Django serves
  it (WhiteNoise for assets, an index.html fallback for client-side routes) at
  `/` with the API under `/api`.

## Deploy to Azure (App Service + ACR + Postgres)

### 1. Provision infrastructure (Bicep)

```bash
az group create -n <rg> -l eastus
az deployment group create \
  -g <rg> \
  -f infra/main.bicep \
  -p infra/parameters/prod.parameters.json \
  -p pgAdminPassword='<choose-a-strong-secret>'
```

This creates an Azure Container Registry, a PostgreSQL Flexible Server (+ `app`
database), and a Linux container App Service. The Web App uses a system-assigned
managed identity with **AcrPull** to pull images — no registry credentials are
stored. `DATABASE_URL` is injected as an app setting automatically.

Edit `infra/parameters/<env>.parameters.json` (`appName`, `imageName`,
`appServiceSku`) per environment. `pgAdminPassword` is `@secure()` — pass it at
deploy time, never commit it.

### 2. Wire up CD (`cd.yml`)

The workflow builds the image in ACR and points the Web App at it on every push
to `main`. Configure once:

- **OIDC federated credentials** for a Microsoft Entra app/service principal
  with access to the resource group, then add repo **secrets**:
  `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.
- Repo **variables**: `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `AZURE_ACR_NAME`,
  `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME`.

The deploy job is gated on `AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME` — until you set it, the workflow
no-ops, so it's safe to merge before Azure is set up.

## Deploy to Azure Container Apps (ACA + ACR + Postgres)

The ACA variant runs the same container image on a serverless platform with
scale-to-zero and a dedicated migration Job. Migrations do **not** run in the
container entrypoint here (`RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_START=false`) — a separate Job owns
them, because multiple replicas would otherwise race.

### 1. Provision infrastructure (Bicep)

```bash
az group create -n <rg> -l eastus
az deployment group create \
  -g <rg> \
  -f infra/main.aca.bicep \
  -p infra/parameters/aca.prod.parameters.json \
  -p pgAdminPassword='<choose-a-strong-secret>'
```

This creates an ACR, a PostgreSQL Flexible Server, a Container Apps managed
environment (+ Log Analytics), the Container App, and a manual-trigger **migration
Job**. The app and Job each use a system-assigned identity with **AcrPull**.

Edit `infra/parameters/aca.<env>.parameters.json` per environment:

- `minReplicas` — **defaults to `1` (always-warm)**. Set to `0` for scale-to-zero
  (idle ≈ $0, at the cost of a cold start on the first request after idle).
- `maxReplicas`, `cpu`, `memory` — scale/size per environment.

### 2. Wire up CD (`cd.yml`)

On every push to `main` the workflow: builds the image in ACR → points the
migration Job at the new image, **runs it, and waits** (a failed migration stops
the deploy — traffic is never routed to a new image against an un-migrated schema)
→ updates the Container App to the new revision.

- Repo **secrets**: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.
- Repo **variables**: `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `AZURE_ACR_NAME`,
  `AZURE_CONTAINERAPP_NAME`, `AZURE_CONTAINERAPP_JOB`.

Gated on `AZURE_CONTAINERAPP_NAME` — no-op until set.

### 3. Run migrations / one-off commands manually

The migration Job is provisioned once and invocable any time. The default command
is `migrate --noinput`; override it to run any management command:

```bash
# default migration
az containerapp job start -g <rg> -n <job-name>

# one-off command (createsuperuser, loaddata, a contract migration, etc.)
az containerapp job start -g <rg> -n <job-name> \
  --command "/bin/sh" --args "-c","python manage.py createsuperuser --noinput"
```

Use this for: a migration that failed mid-deploy, long data backfills kept out of
the deploy path, expand/contract (drop-column) migrations run after the new code is
healthy, rollbacks, and DB-restore catch-up.

### 4. Ephemeral preview environments (`automation-deploy-test` label)

Add the **`automation-deploy-test`** label to a PR and `cd-preview.yml` deploys a
throwaway `…-pr-<n>` Container App (min 0 / max 1 replica → ~$0 idle), links it in
the PR description, and tears it down — striking the link through — when the PR
closes or the label is removed. Preview apps migrate themselves on cold start
(single replica, so no race).

**Database:**
- Set a repo **secret** `PREVIEW_DATABASE_URL` to point previews at a real database
  (e.g. a shared dev Postgres).
- **If it is not set**, the preview falls back to **ephemeral in-container SQLite**
  and seeds a Django admin so the preview is immediately usable. Configure the admin
  via repo **variables** `PREVIEW_ADMIN_USERNAME` (default `admin`) /
  `PREVIEW_ADMIN_EMAIL` and the repo **secret** `PREVIEW_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
  (default `changeme` — set it). The SQLite DB and seeded user are recreated on each
  cold start, which is fine for a throwaway preview.

## Notes

- For production, restrict the Postgres firewall (the starter allows Azure
  services broadly) and consider Private Endpoints / VNet integration.
- App Service: scale the Plan and Postgres SKUs via the Bicep parameters.
- ACA: tune `minReplicas`/`maxReplicas`/`cpu`/`memory`; `minReplicas=0` trades a
  cold start for near-zero idle cost.
