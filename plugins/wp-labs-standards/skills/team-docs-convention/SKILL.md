# Team Docs Convention

When creating or referencing design specs and implementation plans, use these paths and
naming — they **override** any default a skill suggests (e.g. superpowers' `docs/superpowers/specs/`
and `docs/superpowers/plans/`):

- **Specs:** `<repo-top-level>/.superpowers/01-specs/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm-<name-of-spec>.md`
- **Plans:** `<repo-top-level>/.superpowers/02-plans/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm-<name-of-plan>.md`

Rules:
- Use a 24-hour `HHmm` timestamp in the filename so multiple docs created the same day sort correctly.
- `<name-of-spec>` / `<name-of-plan>` is a short kebab-case slug.
- **Always the top-level repository's `.superpowers/`.** When you are working in a git worktree,
  write to the **main working tree's** `.superpowers/`, not the worktree's — resolve it with
  `git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel`. This way every
  worktree shares one durable location and the docs survive the worktree being removed.
- **When you create `.superpowers/01-specs/` or `.superpowers/02-plans/`, drop a self-ignoring
  `.gitignore` into it** so its contents never reach git — the same pattern superpowers uses for
  its `sdd/` scratch:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p <repo-top-level>/.superpowers/01-specs && printf '*\n' > <repo-top-level>/.superpowers/01-specs/.gitignore
  mkdir -p <repo-top-level>/.superpowers/02-plans && printf '*\n' > <repo-top-level>/.superpowers/02-plans/.gitignore
  ```
  The `*` ignores everything in the folder, including the `.gitignore` itself, so nothing is
  tracked and the host repo's root `.gitignore` is left untouched.
- **Specs and plans are git-ignored working copies — do NOT commit them.** The GitHub tracking
  issue (see the lifecycle below) is their durable record. This overrides any "commit the design
  document / plan to git" step in the brainstorming or writing-plans skills.

If you are following the superpowers brainstorming or writing-plans skills, substitute these
paths wherever they reference `docs/superpowers/specs/` or `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

## Lifecycle: spec → issue → plan-comment → feature docs

These steps apply whether you use stock superpowers or the team fork:

1. **Spec → issue** (after the spec is approved): if the spec derives from an existing GitHub
   issue, append it as a comment (`gh issue comment <n> --body-file <spec>`). Otherwise ask
   `Create a GitHub tracking issue for this spec? (Y/n)` and on yes create it
   (`gh issue create --title "<slug>" --body-file <spec>`). Record `Tracking issue: <url>` in the
   spec file (a working copy — not committed). The issue is the spec's durable record.
2. **Plan → comment** (after the plan is saved): read the spec's `Tracking issue:` line and post
   the plan as a comment (`gh issue comment <n> --body-file <plan>`). Skip if no issue is linked.
3. **Implementation → docs** (after implementation completes): write a task-oriented
   usage/adaptation guide for the feature into `docs/<kebab-name>.md` — a how-to guide, not a
   dated changelog.

If `gh` is missing or unauthenticated, report and continue; never block on it.
